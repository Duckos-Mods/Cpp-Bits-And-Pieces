# Cpp-Bits-And-Pieces

Cpp Bits And Pieces is a littile personal storage of all small components i make. 
This IS NOT intended to be super professional or perform the best.  I just want to make a large ammount of the things i use my self so i thought i would make a git hub repo just incase others wanted to look.

# Contributing

Since this Repo is more of a personal project and not some big thing just make a PR and ill have a look. Try to stick to the coding style and use the lates stabel C++ (so C++ 20 at the time of writing this)  
Only thing is when making PRs explain what that PR does dont just pull and change everything and not explain why
